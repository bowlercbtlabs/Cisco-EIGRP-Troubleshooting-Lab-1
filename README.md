# Cisco EIGRP Troubleshooting - Lab 1

## Trouble Ticket #1

### Problem
- After giving your junior level network administrator access to R3 you have noticed that you are unable to form an EIGRP neighbor Relationship between R1 and R3.
- Further troubleshooting shows that R3 is also unable to form an EIGRP neighbor relationship with R4.

### Desired outcome
- Configure the network so that EIGRP neighbor relationships are restored between R1 and R3, and alsobetween R3 and R4.
- You are only allowed to modify, add or delete one command to complete the task.

## Trouble Ticket #2

### Problem
- After you have restored the above connectivity, your junior level network administrator points out that all traffic is using the slower T1 connection to get from R1’s loopback 0 interface (1.1.1.1) to R4’s loopback 0 interface (4.4.4.4).

### Desired outcome
- Configure the network so that R1 prefers the 100MB Fast Ethernet connection to get to R4’s loopback 0 interface (4.4.4.4). Once completed, you should be able to trace and ping from R1’s loopback 0 interface to R4’s loopback 0 interface
successfully.
